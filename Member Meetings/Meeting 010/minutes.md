1. Annual Report from the President
  * Kwartzlab has had a great year. We've grown a lot, and done well financially. New 3d printer from our own money, no grants. We're taking this to the next level. With the growth in membership comes challenges, and the Board has put together a long term strategy document, as well as a new Team system, and an array of strong candidates for this year's Board. 
  We're also searching for real estate, because it would be nice to have a bigger space. Things are happening, and we have an exciting year ahead of us. It'll be a year of growth, cooperation, and community. We need more people involved, helping out and running things, and we're excited for the Team system to direct that. We want to create leaders, and elevate them in our club and community.

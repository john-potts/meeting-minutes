## Report from President
* 176: Kwartzlab is awesome. 
* 177: Kwartzlab is awesome.
* 178: Kwartzlab is awesome.
* 179: Why should I buck tradition at this point? Kwartzlab is awesome. 
* 180: Final log. I think Kwartzlab is potentially going to become more awesome. We have a strong set of candidates for the board, with ten people, including ex board members, three people from MakerExpo, etc. It feels like we might be entering into an interesting area of change and improvement, and I look forward to seeing what the next board accomplishes. 

I don't have a retrospective or anything, but I still have my President's speech at the AGM, so I'll try and be more coherent then.
